# How to Scrape Useful Data from Instagram

> Are you interested in extracting data from Instagram? Do you want to collect large-scale data from this platform? Scraping is the way to go. Discover the best Instagram data scrapers on the marketâ€”and learn how to build your own.

Instagram, a photo and video-sharing platform owned by Facebook, is a massive source of social data. While it doesnâ€™t store as much personal data as Facebook, it still holds a wealth of other informationâ€”particularly among younger generations. Key data from Instagram includes user profiles, posts (images and videos), and associated comments. Businesses and researchers urgently need this data for audience analysis, workflow optimization, content creation, and other studies.

However, the **official Instagram API** limits access to data with stringent API call restrictions. If you want to access public data not tied to your account, you need tools outside of Instagramâ€™s official APIâ€”specifically **Instagram scrapers**. An Instagram scraper is a computer program designed to automate the extraction of data from Instagram. It works by sending HTTP requests to the desired web pages, parsing the needed data, and storing it in a database for further use.

## Instagram Scraping Overview

Instagram has strict policies against the use of scrapers, crawlers, and bots on its platform. Its [Terms of Use](https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/before-january-19-2013/) prohibit web scraping tools, yet many still rely on them to collect Instagram data. The official API often falls short for large-scale or in-depth data collection. 

Instagram also employs one of the most advanced anti-bot systems to detect and block automated traffic. To avoid detection and prevent bans, youâ€™ll need to use proxiesâ€”**mobile proxies** are the most effective, but residential proxies are an alternative for smaller budgets.

## Building an Instagram Scraper with Python and Selenium

For developers, Instagramâ€™s web application is the best option to target, as its requests are relatively easy to replicate. Since the platform heavily relies on JavaScript, scraping tools like **Requests** and **BeautifulSoup** may not suffice. Instead, youâ€™ll need a tool that can render JavaScript, such as **headless browsers**.

Hereâ€™s a basic example of an Instagram scraper built using **Python** and **Selenium**:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

class InstagramScraper:

    def __init__(self, post_url):
        self.post_url = post_url
        self.comments = []
        chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
        chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
        self.chrome = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=chrome_options)

    def scrape_comments(self):
        self.chrome.get(self.post_url)
        comments = self.chrome.find_element_by_class_name("XQXOT").find_elements_by_class_name("Mr508")
        for comment in comments:
            poster = comment.find_element_by_tag_name("h3").text
            post = comment.find_element_by_tag_name("span").text
            self.comments.append({"poster": poster, "post": post})
        return self.comments

post_url = "https://www.instagram.com/p/CAbDmzDnSvn/"
scraper = InstagramScraper(post_url)
print(scraper.scrape_comments())
```

This code demonstrates how to scrape comments from an Instagram post using Selenium. While effective, more sophisticated tools and configurations are needed for advanced use cases.
