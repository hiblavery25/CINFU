# How to Speed Up Your Python Web Scraper Using Multiprocessing

Web scraping can be a time-consuming process, especially when you're handling a large number of pages or URLs. In this guide, I'll show you how to significantly reduce the runtime of your web scrapers using Python's multiprocessing module. By following this simple method, you'll be able to scrape data more efficiently and effectively.

## Overview

In previous posts, I covered [how to write your first web scraper](http://blog.adnansiddiqi.me/write-your-first-web-scraper-in-python-with-beautifulsoup/) and [tips to make your scraper efficient](http://blog.adnansiddiqi.me/6-things-to-develop-an-efficient-web-scraper-in-python/). While those methods are useful for building a solid foundation, they don't necessarily address speed and performance. 

In this post, I'll demonstrate how just a few changes to your code can speed up your scraper by several times. Keep reading to learn more!

### Example Without Multiprocessing

Imagine you're scraping the details of listings from a website like OLX. The goal is to fetch all URLs from a page such as [this OLX Cars page](https://www.olx.com.pk/cars/). For simplicity, we'll ignore pagination in this example. Here's a basic approach to access and parse listings:

1. Use a function `get_listing()` to fetch the URLs of all entries.
2. Use another function `parse(url)` to fetch and parse the details of each entry.

Here's the execution time of a sequential scraper:

```bash
$ time python listing_seq.py

real    5m49.168s
user    0m2.876s
sys     0m0.198s
```

For 50 records, the script took nearly 6 minutes. This includes a 2-second delay per iteration, but the overall runtime could be significantly reduced.

### Introducing Multiprocessing

By using Python's `multiprocessing` module, you can run multiple processes in parallel and dramatically speed up your scraper. Here's how to do it:

#### Step 1: Import the Multiprocessing Module

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
```

#### Step 2: Modify Your Code

Replace the sequential scraping logic with multiprocessing. For example:

```python
p = Pool(10)  # Pool size: 10 subprocesses
records = p.map(parse, cars_links)
p.terminate()
p.join()
```

#### Explanation:

- **Pool(10)**: This creates a pool of 10 subprocesses, meaning 10 URLs will be processed simultaneously.
- **p.map(parse, cars_links)**: The `parse` function is applied to each URL in the `cars_links` list.
- **p.terminate()**: Ensures that all processes are terminated after execution.
- **p.join()**: Waits for all subprocesses to finish, avoiding zombie processes.

Alternatively, you can simplify this process using a **context manager**:

```python
with Pool(10) as p:
    records = p.map(parse, cars_links)
```

#### Step 3: Benchmark the Improved Scraper

Run the updated script:

```bash
$ time python list_parallel.py
```

Output with 10 subprocesses:

```bash
real    0m22.884s
user    0m2.748s
sys     0m0.363s
```

With a smaller pool size (e.g., 5):

```bash
real    0m43.695s
user    0m2.829s
sys     0m0.336s
```

As you can see, the execution time was reduced from nearly 6 minutes to just 22 secondsâ€”a massive improvement!

### Tips to Avoid Zombie Processes

When using multiprocessing, it's important to properly terminate and join all processes. Failure to do so can result in [zombie processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process) that consume system resources unnecessarily. Always use `terminate()` and `join()` or a context manager to clean up processes.

### Challenges of Web Scraping

Writing a fast scraper is just one part of the process. Many websites block scrapers by detecting their IP addresses or imposing CAPTCHAs. If you're an individual, managing proxies and handling CAPTCHAs can be challenging and expensive.
