### **Applicable Amazon Marketplaces:**  
Supports virtually all marketplaces.

This plugin allows you to extract ASIN lists from any Amazon page—be it product detail pages, seller store pages, or search result pages. It has no restrictions and delivers detailed results, including ASINs, total count, prices, seller names, FBA or FBM status, and complete hyperlinks. Best of all? It’s completely free, and the developers promise to keep updating it for free.

### **Step 2: Collecting ASINs from Product Pages**

#### **Option 1:**
Click the plugin button in the top-right corner of your browser.

#### **Option 2:**
Alternatively, click the button directly under the product title. See the image below for reference.

This displays results organized by different sellers. From here, you can further scrape ASINs from seller stores.

### **Step 3: Collecting ASINs from Search or Seller Store Pages**

#### **Step 3.1:**
On search result or seller store pages, click the plugin’s ASIN collection button. Once the status bar at the bottom shows “ASINFetcher is Finished,” it means the collection process is complete for that page.

#### **Step 3.2:**
On the results page, you’ll see the total number of ASINs collected, with options to filter, rearrange, and export the data.

> **Note:** There seems to be a pricing display issue for search results on the US site, but other sites like the UK site display correctly.
