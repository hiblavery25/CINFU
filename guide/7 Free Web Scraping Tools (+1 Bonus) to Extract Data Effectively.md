# 7 Free Web Scraping Tools (+1 Bonus) to Extract Data Effectively

## What is Web Scraping?

**Web scraping** (from the English "to scrape," meaning "to collect" or "gather") is a data extraction technique that automates the process of collecting information from websites. Using specialized tools, web scraping allows users to scan websites and gather specific data while avoiding unnecessary elements like formatting or images.

Even **Google** uses scraping methods via its parsers to analyze website content and catalog it effectively. Scraping relies on analyzing the **HTML structure** of a website to identify recurring patterns and extract only the relevant information.

### Example of Web Scraping in Action

Imagine you're searching for the best movies released in 2017. You find a website with a list of films, their genres, release years, and other details. Instead of copying and pasting this data manually, scraping tools can automatically extract only the details you need. For instance:

- Title: `h5` class = "title"
- Genre: Text inside `span` class = "genre"
- Year: Text inside `span` class = "year"

Using scraping tools, this process becomes fast, efficient, and automated.
