## What Is an eBay Scraper?

An eBay scraper is a tool that automates the process of extracting specific information from eBay. Whether you‚Äôre looking for the latest deals on Nike sneakers or tracking prices for vintage home goods, a scraper can quickly collect and organize this data into a readable format.

### How Does It Work?

An eBay scraper sifts through a website‚Äôs **HTML structure**, retrieving relevant information like product names, prices, seller details, and more. Instead of manually scrolling through thousands of listings, a scraper automates the process, saving you time and effort.

### Why Use an eBay Scraper?

For instance, imagine searching for ‚Äúlaptop computers‚Äù on eBay. With over 100,000 results, finding the right product can feel overwhelming. A scraper simplifies this task by narrowing down listings based on criteria like price, condition, or seller rating. This makes it an invaluable tool not only for shoppers but also for professionals in fields like **marketing** and **sales**.
