2. Receive the raw HTML response of the requested page.

For example:

```bash
curl "https://api.scraperapi.com?api_key=SCRAPE9837861&url=https://httpbin.org/ip"

On the backend, ScraperAPI uses its proxy servers to fetch the data and sends it back to you, all while managing headers, IP rotation, and more.

To send requests from a specific country, include the `country_code` parameter (e.g., `country_code=us`) in your API call.

#### POST/PUT Requests
Advanced users can issue POST or PUT requests to scrape forms or API endpoints directly.

#### Account Dashboard
ScraperAPI provides a user-friendly dashboard to monitor your usage, requests, and failed attempts. You can also programmatically monitor your account through the `/account` endpoint, which returns JSON data.
