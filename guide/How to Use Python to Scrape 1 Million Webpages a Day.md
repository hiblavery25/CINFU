# How to Use Python to Scrape 1 Million Webpages a Day

![High-Performance Web Scraping](https://www.yuanrenxue.cn/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/high-performance-crawler.jpg)

Web scraping is a skill that has become increasingly essential in the last few years. Whether you're in tech, product development, data analysis, finance, or building an early-stage startup, scraping data can often give you the edge you need. However, most people only scrape tens of thousands of pages, which can often be accomplished using simple browser extensions like **Web Scraper** or by driving Chrome with **Selenium**.

This article focuses on maximizing the performance of your scraping setup without using heavy frameworks like Scrapy, relying instead on **multithreading** and the Python `requests` library. If you're looking to scrape millions of pages in a day on a single machine, follow this guide for optimizing storage, memory, URL deduplication, and more.

## 1. Optimize Disk Storage

When scraping millions of pages, you need to carefully consider how to store the data. Letâ€™s break it down:

- A single webpage averages **400KB** in size.
- Scraping **1 billion webpages** would require **36TB** of storage.

This far exceeds what a typical computer can handle. To solve this, compress your scraped data using libraries like `zlib`, `bz2`, or `pylzma`. For example:

- A **700KB company details page** on Tianyancha compresses to **100KB** with `zlib`.
- Removing unnecessary `<head>` and `<footer>` elements reduces it further to **300KB**, and compression can bring it down to **47KB**.

With proper storage optimization, you can reduce your disk usage to a manageable **4TB** for 1 billion pages, which can be stored on a single affordable **4TB hard drive**.

## 2. Optimize Memory and URL Deduplication

Efficiently handling URLs is another challenge:

- A single URL like `https://www.tianyancha.com/company/23402373` is **44 bytes**. 
- Storing 1 billion URLs directly in memory would require **4GB of RAM** just for the raw stringsâ€”not including overhead from data structures.

### Techniques to Reduce Memory Usage:

- **Truncate URLs**: Instead of storing the entire URL, only store the unique identifier (e.g., `23402373`). This reduces memory usage from **44 bytes to 8 bytes**, cutting storage to **700MB for 1 billion URLs**.
- **Bloom Filters**: Use this efficient algorithm for deduplication. A Bloom Filter maps each URL to a single bit, significantly reducing memory consumption. For example, a 1-bit-per-URL Bloom Filter for 1 billion URLs requires only **10MB of RAM**.

Hereâ€™s how to install and use the `bloom_filter` library:

```bash
pip install bloom-filter
```

## 3. Overcome Anti-Scraping Limits

### IP Blocking

Most websites will block a single IP address if it sends too many requests in a short period. Overcoming this limitation involves:

- **Understanding anti-scraping strategies**: For example, some websites impose stricter limits on detail pages than on listing pages or apply weaker controls to specific user agents or referrers.
- **Using multiple IPs**: Rotate between proxies or use **ADSL dial-up** to dynamically switch IP addresses.

### Proxy Pools vs. ADSL Dial-Up

- **Proxy Pools**: Paid proxy services are effective but expensive. At a cost of **$0.04 per IP**, scraping **8640 IPs/day** would cost **$345/day**.
- **ADSL Dial-Up**: This is a cost-effective alternative, with monthly plans costing around **$100**. Dial-up setups allow for rapid IP rotation by reconnecting after short intervals.

### Selecting the Right ADSL Provider

When choosing an ADSL provider, look for services with a wide range of IP addresses. Some only rotate within the **C/D class** (e.g., `110.132.X.X`), which could result in bans across large IP ranges. Test providers to find one with **hundreds of thousands of available IPs**.

## 4. Fine-Tuning Performance

To reach **1 million pages/day**, you'll need to optimize both your network performance and scraping logic:

### Multi-Threading

- Start with a single thread and measure how many pages you can scrape before the IP is banned.
- Gradually increase the number of threads until performance peaks. For example, in one test:

| Threads | Time (sec) | Successful Requests |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| 1       | 10         | 20                 |
| 4       | 8          | 75                 |
| 6       | 6          | 100                |

In this case, 6 threads provide the best performance.

### Adjust Dial-Up Timing

- Reconnect your ADSL after every **120 successful requests** rather than at fixed intervals. This minimizes unnecessary reconnections and ensures optimal IP usage.

### Optimize Requests

- Set a timeout for `requests.get()`. A timeout of **1.5 seconds** is idealâ€”waiting for 10 seconds on a failed request would significantly reduce scraping speed.

Hereâ€™s an example of an optimized ADSL dial-up script:

```python
import os
import time

def reconnect_adsl():
    os.popen('rasdial "NetworkName" "Username" "Password"')
    time.sleep(6)  # Allow time for reconnection

def is_connected():
    return os.system("ping -c 1 google.com") == 0

while not is_connected():
    reconnect_adsl()
```

## 5. Calculate Efficiency

Using the above optimizations, a single machine can scrape **64,000 pages/day**:

- Each scraping cycle takes **16 seconds** (6 seconds for scraping + 10 seconds for reconnection).
- In one day (86,400 seconds), you can complete **5400 cycles**.
- With 120 successful requests per cycle, this results in **64,800 pages/day**.

To scale up, deploy additional ADSL machines. With just two machines, you can easily reach **1 million pages/day**.

## Final Tips for Ethical Scraping

1. **Avoid Overloading Target Websites**  
   Respect bandwidth limitations and avoid scraping at a rate that could disrupt their services.

2. **Use Scraping Responsibly**  
   Scraping is a powerful tool, but ensure your activities comply with the site's terms of service.
